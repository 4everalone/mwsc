# MWSC

WSDL to IOS Objective-C and Android Java Code Generator based on JAX-WS Wsimport

## Feature Highlight
1. ***Standard based*** : based on [Oracle JAX-WS 2.1](http://jax-ws.java.net/2.1.1) Wsimport, recognize most standard WSDL and XML Schema components.
2. ***Objective-C Pico Binding Support*** : auto-generate [Pico for IOS](https://github.com/bulldog2011/pico) supported proxy from WSDL.
3. ***Android Nano Binding Support*** : auto-generate [Nano for Android](https://github.com/bulldog2011/nano) supported proxy from WSDL[planned for next release].
4. ***Doc Auto Generation*** : auto-generate code comments from WSDL and XML Schema annotations.
5. ***JAX-WS/JAXB Binding Customization*** : support binding customization in case the code generated by defaut binding does not meet real needs. 

##How to Use

Download zip package from repository mentioned in version history below, latest stable release is [0.5.0](https://github.com/bulldog2011/bulldog-repo/tree/master/repo/releases/com/leansoft/mwsc/0.5.0), then extract the zip file and run mwsc script in command line:

	Usage: mwsc [options] <WSDL_URI>
	
	where [options] include:
	  -pico                     target Pico for IOS as code generation target(default)
	  -prefix <prefix>          add prefix to the target classes, only for pico binding
	                            (recommended to avoid possible name conflict)
	  -b <path>                 specify jaxws/jaxb binding files or additional schemas
	                            (Each <path> must have its own -b)
	  -B<jaxbOption>            Pass this option to JAXB schema compiler
	  -d <directory>            specify where to place generated source files
	  -help                     display help
	  -httpproxy:<host>:<port>  specify a HTTP proxy server (port defaults to 8080)
	  -p <pkg>                  specifies the target package
	  -quiet                    suppress mswc output
	  -verbose                  output messages about what the compiler is doing
	  -version                  print JAX-WS version information
	
	
	Examples:
	  wsimport -pico -prefix StockWS_ -d generated http://example.org/stock?wsdl
	  wsimport stock.wsdl -b stock.xml -b stock.xjb
